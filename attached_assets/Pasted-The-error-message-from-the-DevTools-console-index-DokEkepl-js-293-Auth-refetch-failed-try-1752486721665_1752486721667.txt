The error message from the DevTools console:

```
index-DokEkepl.js:293  Auth refetch failed, trying again...
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What This Error Means

This message indicates that the JavaScript code at line 293 of the file `index-DokEkepl.js` attempted to **refetch authentication data**‚Äîlikely a token or session‚Äîbut the attempt failed. The system is programmed to retry automatically.

### üß© Possible Causes

Here are some common reasons why an authentication refetch might fail:

- **Expired or invalid token**: The user's session token may have expired or become invalid.
- **Network issues**: Temporary connectivity problems could prevent the request from reaching the server.
- **Server-side error**: The authentication endpoint might be down or misconfigured.
- **Incorrect credentials or headers**: The request may be missing required headers or using incorrect credentials.
- **CORS or security restrictions**: If the request is blocked due to cross-origin policies, it could fail silently or throw an error.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix It

Depending on the root cause, here are some steps to resolve the issue:

#### 1. **Check the Authentication Endpoint**
- Ensure the backend service responsible for authentication is running and accessible.
- Look at server logs for any errors when handling the auth refetch.

#### 2. **Inspect the Request**
- Use DevTools Network tab to inspect the failed request.
- Verify that the request includes the correct headers (e.g., `Authorization`) and payload.

#### 3. **Handle Token Expiry Gracefully**
- Implement logic to refresh tokens before they expire.
- If using JWTs, check the `exp` claim and refresh proactively.

#### 4. **Improve Error Handling**
- Instead of retrying blindly, add logic to detect specific failure reasons and prompt the user to re-authenticate if needed.

#### 5. **Check CORS Settings**
- If the frontend and backend are on different domains, ensure the backend allows cross-origin requests from the frontend.
