The error message you‚Äôre seeing in the DevTools Console:

```
index-DOVIrZYk.js:48   GET https://f1e7a9b6-d1eb-478b-aae0-a79f446d067a.riker.prod.repl.run/api/me 401 (Unauthorized)
```

means that the web page attempted to make a request to the `/api/me` endpoint, but the server responded with a **401 Unauthorized** status. Here's what that typically indicates:

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What the Error Means

- **401 Unauthorized**: The request lacks valid authentication credentials. The server is rejecting the request because it doesn't recognize the user as logged in or authorized.
- **Endpoint `/api/me`**: This is usually used to fetch the current user's profile or session data. It assumes the user is authenticated.

---

### üß© Possible Causes

- **Missing or expired login session**: The user may not be logged in, or their session token (e.g., cookie or JWT) has expired.
- **Incorrect or missing authorization headers**: The frontend may have failed to include the required token in the request headers.
- **Backend misconfiguration**: The server might not be correctly validating tokens or sessions.
- **CORS or cookie issues**: If the site relies on cookies for authentication, cross-origin settings or browser restrictions might prevent them from being sent.

### ‚úÖ How to Fix It

Here are some steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Ensure the user is logged in**:
   - Try logging in again via the site‚Äôs login flow.
   - Check if a valid session cookie or token is present.

2. **Check request headers**:
   - If using token-based auth (e.g., JWT), make sure the `Authorization` header is set correctly:
     ```http
     Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
     ```

3. **Inspect cookies**:
   - Open the browser‚Äôs Application tab in DevTools and verify that authentication cookies are present and not expired.

4. **Backend validation**:
   - If you're developing the backend, ensure that the `/api/me` endpoint correctly checks for authentication and returns 401 only when appropriate.

5. **Frontend logic**:
   - Make sure the frontend only calls `/api/me` after confirming the user is authenticated.
