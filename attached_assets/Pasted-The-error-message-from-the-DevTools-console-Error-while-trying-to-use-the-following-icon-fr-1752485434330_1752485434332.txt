The error message from the DevTools console:

```
Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: https://124a8c33-4a0e-48d7-8267-289b4f9fd91f.riker.prod.repl.run/icon-192x192.png (Download error or resource isn't a valid image)
```

### üß© What It Means
This error indicates that the browser attempted to load an icon specified in the web app manifest (`icon-192x192.png`) but failed because:
- The image could not be downloaded (e.g. 404 Not Found)
- The image exists but is not a valid image format (e.g. corrupted or wrong MIME type)

This icon is typically used for Progressive Web App (PWA) features like home screen shortcuts or splash screens.

---

### üîç Possible Causes
- **Broken URL**: The image file might not exist at the specified path.
- **Incorrect MIME type**: The server might be serving the image with a non-image content type.
- **Corrupted image**: The file might be damaged or not properly encoded.
- **Permission issues**: The server might block access to the image due to CORS or authentication.

### ‚úÖ How to Fix It
Here are steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Verify the Image URL**  
   Open [https://124a8c33-4a0e-48d7-8267-289b4f9fd91f.riker.prod.repl.run/icon-192x192.png](https://124a8c33-4a0e-48d7-8267-289b4f9fd91f.riker.prod.repl.run/icon-192x192.png) directly in your browser.  
   - If it shows a 404 error, the file is missing.
   - If it downloads but doesn‚Äôt open as an image, it may be corrupted.

2. **Check the Manifest File**  
   Ensure the manifest references the correct path and filename:
   ```json
   {
     "icons": [
       {
         "src": "/icon-192x192.png",
         "type": "image/png",
         "sizes": "192x192"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Replace or Re-upload the Image**  
   - Make sure the image is a valid PNG file.
   - Upload it to the correct location on your server.

4. **Set Correct MIME Type**  
   Ensure your server serves the image with `Content-Type: image/png`.
