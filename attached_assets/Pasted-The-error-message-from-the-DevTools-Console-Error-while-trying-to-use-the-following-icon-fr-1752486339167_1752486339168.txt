The error message from the DevTools Console:

```
Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: https://742cc05a-8755-4df0-b6ba-bcf2f18ecb3e.riker.prod.repl.run/icon-192x192.png (Download error or resource isn't a valid image)
```

### ðŸ§© What This Error Means

This error indicates that the browser attempted to load an icon defined in the site's Web App Manifest (`icon-192x192.png`) but failed because:

- The image could not be downloaded (e.g. 404 Not Found)
- The image exists but is not a valid image file (e.g. corrupted or wrong MIME type)

This icon is typically used for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) â€” for things like home screen shortcuts or splash screens.

### ðŸš¨ Possible Causes

Here are the most common reasons this error occurs:

- **Missing File**: The image file `icon-192x192.png` does not exist at the specified URL.
- **Incorrect MIME Type**: The server may be serving the file with a wrong content type (e.g. `text/html` instead of `image/png`).
- **Corrupted Image**: The image file is present but not properly formatted or damaged.
- **Manifest Reference Error**: The manifest file may reference a wrong or outdated path.

### âœ… How to Fix It

To resolve the issue, try the following steps:

1. **Verify the Image URL**  
   Open [https://742cc05a-8755-4df0-b6ba-bcf2f18ecb3e.riker.prod.repl.run/icon-192x192.png](https://742cc05a-8755-4df0-b6ba-bcf2f18ecb3e.riker.prod.repl.run/icon-192x192.png) directly in your browser.  
   - If you get a 404 error, the file is missing.
   - If it loads but doesnâ€™t display as an image, it may be corrupted or misconfigured.

2. **Check the Manifest File**  
   Ensure the manifest (`manifest.json`) correctly references the icon:
   ```json
   {
     "icons": [
       {
         "src": "/icon-192x192.png",
         "type": "image/png",
         "sizes": "192x192"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Upload a Valid Image**  
   Make sure `icon-192x192.png` is:
   - A valid PNG file
   - Exactly 192x192 pixels
   - Uploaded to the correct path

4. **Set Correct MIME Type**  
   Ensure your server serves the image with the correct MIME type (`image/png`). You can check this in the Network tab of DevTools.
